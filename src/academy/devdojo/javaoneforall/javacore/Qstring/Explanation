=== Strings ===

*Are immutable*

== String Constant Pool ==

A reserved place inside Memory Heap to save Strings
You never can change a value in the String Pool
String name3 = new String("Renzo"); -> Create a reference variable, an object outside the pool (normal object) and an object inside the pool (if not exists), but referees to the outside object, if you use the method intern() you can reference the inside object

= Comparing Strings =
name == name2; // Comparing references of the object in the pool, not the value
System.out.println(name2 == name3); // A comparison of an outside object and an object from the pool
System.out.println(name2 == name3.intern()); // Comparate to the object value in the pool (if he is in the pool)
