All the errors and instances are an instance of Throwable

Error â‰  Exception (They aren't subclass)
Errors can't be treated, and rarely are caught by the code, because he is a problem of the JVM, not of the program (OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError...)
Exceptions can be caught and treated during the execution of the program (IOException, NullPointerException...

Exceptions can be checked and unchecked
Checked -> Exceptions directly daughters of Exception, if they don't treat, the program can't be compiled
Unchecked -> They are subclasses of RuntimeException or is she, they generally are caused by the developer
